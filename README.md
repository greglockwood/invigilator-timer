# Invigilator Timer App

A cross-platform exam invigilation timer for managing desks with individual students and variable D.P. (Disability Provision) time taken.

## Project Status

### ✅ Implemented

#### Core Architecture
- **Monorepo structure** with apps (mobile) and packages (core, data)
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **Expo SDK 54** for React Native development
- **Expo Router** for file-based navigation

#### Core Domain Logic (`packages/core`)
- Session, Desk, and TimerEvent data models
- Timer phase state machine (PreExam → ReadingTime → ExamActive → DPAdjustments)
- Monotonic timer calculations (using `performance.now()`)
- Activation-driven actions (exam start, D.P. apply, pause/resume)
- Desk sorting by adjusted finish time
- Colour cue logic (green >30min, amber 10-30min, red <10min)
- Time formatting utilities (Australian English format)

#### Data Persistence (`packages/data`)
- **SQLite** for authoritative session storage
  - Sessions, desks, and timer_events tables
  - Full audit trail of all activation events
  - Transaction-based saves for atomicity
- **In-memory cache** for UI state (MMKV planned for v2)
  - Last active session tracking
  - Timer state recovery after app restart

#### Mobile App (`apps/mobile`)
- **Home/Sessions Screen**
  - List existing sessions
  - Create new sessions
  - Delete sessions with confirmation
  - Demo session seed for quick testing

- **Create/Edit Session Screen**
  - Exam name, duration, reading time configuration
  - Start time picker (hour:minute)
  - Dynamic desk management (add/remove desks)
  - Optional student names per desk
  - Validation for all inputs
  - "Activate Exam Start" action

- **Active Exam Screen** ⭐ (Primary interface)
  - Live current time display
  - Reading time phase with automatic transition to exam time
  - General exam finish time and remaining time
  - Per-desk displays:
    - Desk number and student name
    - Adjusted finish time (including D.P.)
    - Adjusted remaining time
    - D.P. time entry with activation button
    - Colour-coded borders (green/amber/red)
  - D.P. input resets to zero after activation (per design doc)
  - Automatic desk sorting by earliest finish time
  - Pause/Resume controls
  - End Exam action
  - Screen kept awake via `expo-keep-awake`

#### State Management
- **Zustand** store for global app state
- Database initialization on app launch
- Session persistence on every activation
- Timer state caching for app restart recovery

### 🔄 Cache Implementation Note

**Current:** Simple in-memory cache (data lost on app restart)
- Sufficient for current use case
- Zero configuration issues
- Works immediately

**Planned:** MMKV for production (v2)
- Lightning-fast synchronous API (beats AsyncStorage performance)
- Persistent across app restarts
- Zero-dependency native module
- Currently blocked by Metro bundler module resolution in monorepo
- Will be added once Metro config is refined or project structure simplified

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented / TODO

#### Reliability Features (Android-specific)

Currently implemented:
- ✅ Wake lock (screen stays on via `expo-keep-awake`)
- ✅ Foreground timer updates (setInterval with 1-second interval)

Requires native module integration:
- ⚠️ **Foreground service** - Keeps process alive even if app is backgrounded
  - See `apps/mobile/src/services/reliability.ts` for implementation guide
  - Requires `react-native-foreground-service` or similar package
  - Must display persistent notification during exam
  
- ⚠️ **Exact alarms** - Backstop notifications for desk finish times
  - See `apps/mobile/src/services/reliability.ts` for implementation guide
  - Requires `expo-notifications` with exact alarm permissions
  - Android 13+ requires `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission

#### UI Framework
- Tamagui installed but not yet configured
- Currently using React Native StyleSheet for styling
- Tamagui configuration can be added later for enhanced UI consistency

#### iOS Support
- Core logic is platform-agnostic
- Foreground/wake behaviour differs on iOS
- Testing required on iOS devices

#### Future Enhancements (from design doc)
- CSV export of audit trail
- Student-only display mode
- Multi-room support
- Theming/dark mode
- Cloud sync (optional)
- Accessibility API integration

## Design Principles (from design-doc.md)

1. **Desk-centric model** - Desks are primary, student names are optional metadata
2. **Activation-driven** - All state changes require explicit activation actions
3. **Monotonic timing** - Uses `performance.now()` for countdowns to avoid clock drift
4. **Incremental D.P.** - D.P. time is cumulative; multiple entries per desk allowed
5. **Audit trail** - Every activation event logged to SQLite
6. **Offline-first** - No Internet required
7. **Reliability chain** - UI → Timer Engine → SQLite/Cache → Foreground Service → Wake Lock → Exact Alarms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (or 18.17+, though warnings will appear)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app for testing (or Expo CLI for native builds)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run on Android
npm run mobile:android

# Run on iOS
npm run mobile:ios

# Run on web (for testing layout)
npm run mobile:web
```

### Quick Testing

1. Launch the app
2. Tap "Create Demo Session (Quick Test)" on the home screen
3. A demo session will be created starting in 2 minutes with a 5-minute exam
4. Open the session and tap "Activate Exam Start" when ready
5. Test D.P. time entry and activation
6. Observe colour cues and sorting behaviour

## Key Implementation Details

### Timer Phase Transitions

```
PreExam (manual start)
  ↓ [Activate Exam Start]
ReadingTime (countdown active)
  ↓ [Auto-transition when reading time expires]
ExamActive (general countdown + per-desk countdowns)
  ↓ [D.P. can be applied any time during ExamActive]
DPAdjustments (desk-specific finish times adjusted)
```

### D.P. Time Application Workflow

1. Invigilator enters D.P. minutes in desk input field
2. Invigilator taps "Activate" button
3. System:
   - Adds D.P. minutes to desk's cumulative `dpTimeTakenMinutes`
   - Recalculates `adjustedFinishEpochMs`
   - Records `dp_applied` event to audit trail
   - Persists session to SQLite
   - **Resets D.P. input to zero** (per design doc Excel box 6)
4. Desk re-sorts based on new adjusted finish time

### Desk Sorting

Default sort order (automatic):
1. Earliest adjusted finish time (ascending)
2. Desk number (ascending)

Updates dynamically as D.P. is applied.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (TODO)
- Core timer calculation functions
- D.P. application logic
- Sorting algorithm
- Colour cue determination

### Integration Testing (TODO)
- SQLite persistence
- Timer state restoration
- Pause/resume behaviour
- Phase transitions

### Manual Testing
- Use demo session for quick smoke tests
- Test with realistic 90-minute exam session
- Verify monotonic timing survives app backgrounding
- Test D.P. incremental application (multiple entries per desk)
- Verify audit trail in SQLite database
